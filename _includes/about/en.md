Hi! I'm **「Cat Cat Rabbit」**, the Meow Planet from the J220302 galaxy~

I graduated from Jilin University with a bachelor's degree and am currently studying for a master's degree in computer science at ~~Guanshankou Men's Vocational and Technical College~~ Huazhong University of  Science and Technology.

I am interested in the filed of computer graphics, and I think it is very interesting to use a computer to draw good-looking pictures. I am currently studying and developing in this field, and may develop in the game industry in the future.

Like cat xi dog online, all the delicious things, making all the delicious things, watching the game live (Zelda is God!). . .
