You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

#### 思路

每天可以进行四种动作：buy、sell、cooldown、rest(什么都不干），如果将cooldown和rest合并成一个动作rest。这样可以得到一个状态机，如下图：

rest、hold、sold这三种状态表示的都是**当天收盘后的状态**。

我们用三个数组rest[i]、hold[i]、sold[i]分别表示第i天收盘后，三种状态下能够获得的最大利益

那么有如下状态转移方程：

hold[i] = max(hold[i - 1], rest[i - 1] - prices[i])

sold[i] = hold[i - 1] + prices[i]

rest[i] = max(rest[i - 1], sold[i - 1])

初始化：rest[0] = sold[0] =0, hold[0] = INT_MIN

时间复杂度$O(n)$, 空间复杂度$O(n)$ ，可优化至$O(1)$

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int sold = 0, rest = 0, hold = INT_MIN;
        for(const int price : prices) {
            int prev_sold = sold;
            sold = hold + price;
            hold = max(hold, rest - price);
            rest = max(rest, prev_sold);
        }
        return max(rest, sold);
    }
};
```
