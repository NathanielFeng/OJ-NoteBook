A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == obstacleGrid.length`
- `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

#### 思路

思路同前一题一样，，由于障碍物存在，当$obstacleGrid[i][j] = 1$时，对应的dp为0；否则正常计算即可。

状态转移方程为：

$$dp[i][j] = \begin{cases} dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] & obstacleGrid[i][j] \neq 0 \\ 0 & obstacleGrid[i][j] = 0 \end{cases}$$

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size(), n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        dp[0][0] = obstacleGrid[0][0] ? 0 : 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++) 
            dp[i][0] = obstacleGrid[i][0] ? 0 : dp[i - 1][0];
        for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
            dp[0][j] = obstacleGrid[0][j] ? 0 : dp[0][j - 1];
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j]) 
                    dp[i][j] == 0;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```
