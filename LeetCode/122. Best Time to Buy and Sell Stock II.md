You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return *the **maximum** profit you can achieve*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

#### 思路

利润最大化的方法，累加所有上升曲线的差价。

维护两个变量buyIn和buyOut作为买/卖出时刻，当out一直变大时，不断更新out，只要out一变小，则计算当前profit，并更新in和out作为新的买卖时刻。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int in = 0, out = 0, profit = 0, len = prices.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if(prices[i] > prices[out])
                out = i;
            else {
                profit += prices[out] - prices[in];
                in = out = i;
            }
        }
        return profit + prices[out] - prices[in];
    }
};
```
